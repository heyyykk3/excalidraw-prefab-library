## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If "Open in Excalidraw" doesn't work:

**Check 1: CORS Headers**
GitHub Pages should serve the file with correct headers. If not:
- The file might not be accessible
- Check browser console for CORS errors

**Check 2: File URL**
Verify the file is accessible:
```
https://heyyykk3.github.io/excalidraw-prefab-library/prefab-library-complete.excalidrawlib
```
- Should download the file
- Should be valid JSON

**Check 3: Excalidraw URL**
The final URL should look like:
```
https://excalidraw.com/?addLibrary=https%3A%2F%2Fheyyykk3.github.io%2Fexcalidraw-prefab-library%2Fprefab-library-complete.excalidrawlib
```

### If Download works but Open doesn't:

This means:
- ✅ File is valid
- ✅ Library structure is correct
- ❌ URL loading might have issues

**Solution:** Use the download method for now, submit to official library

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Minimum Requirements:
- [x] File hosted on GitHub Pages
- [x] Direct URL method implemented
- [x] Download button works
- [ ] Open in Excalidraw button works (TEST THIS)
- [ ] All 14 components load correctly (TEST THIS)

### Ideal State:
- [ ] Both buttons work perfectly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Fast loading
- [ ] All components functional

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test both buttons** on the live site
2. **If both work:** Perfect! Ready for official submission
3. **If only download works:** Still good! Submit to official library
4. **Report results:** Let me know what happens

## 📝 Notes

**Why Direct URL is Better:**
- ✅ No blob URL workaround
- ✅ Official Excalidraw method
- ✅ Cleaner code
- ✅ More reliable
- ✅ Works with CORS properly

**GitHub Pages CORS:**
GitHub Pages automatically serves files with correct CORS headers, so the direct URL method should work perfectly.
